 <p>I must tell the truth about it, because I wrote much code without even a bit of documentation for core functions, extensions and worst of all I had 0% code test coverage. I was loosing too much time to look back and get out the API <b>looking at the code</b>, and that drove me into the urgency of code down a solution. I think I found it for both tests issue and documentation lackage.</p>

 <h2>Documentation (core section)</h2>
<p>With <i>core</i> I mean all functionalities that can be found in the library without loading by hand additional extensions, these are : JMVC, Controller, View, Model, Interface, Promise, Event, Errors, dom, events, io, head, util, array, object.</ br>
The documentation is based on an .xml file (documentation.xml) and is shown using a tab extension, but is regards <strong>only</strong> the core section and is far from being completed. In the head  of the Api page I`ll try to keep updated a day countdown, estimated on daily progresses.
All test for each function will be shown within the document. 
</p>

<h2>Extension documentation</h2>
<p>I am thinking about a soution, because the core is 20% and extensions are the 80% of the whole work. I`m waiting for the "eureka tub", but it wasn`t me.</p>

<h2>Test suite</h2>
<p>Googling around I read a <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/javascript-strict-mode/">basic solution</a>. It`s pretty simple, maybe too simple. But has been a good base to start. Thank You Angus.</br>
The testsuite API will clarify every aspect, and even those ones who`s missing, at the moment :D.</p>
<h2>Am I forgetting something?</h2>
<p>Sure, I'm missing the most important thing: <strong>the why</strong>. It's the first thing every developer ask every time he mess with another damn framework, no matter what language it`s for.</ br></p>
