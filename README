Description: jmvc module

Author: Federico Ghedina
Version: 0.1
Date : 26-01-2012


Installation
------------
Thanks to a basic .htaccess jmcv access point is an index.html which loads in the head the main script
and is meant to have empty body, in fact the whole body will be rewritten (see index.html)
NOTE: the src attribute of the script must be the absolute url for jmvc.js
All you have to do is, write controllers, models and views.


Features
--------
- cross-browser
- no global variables so no collision are possible
- url dispatching
- load views and models (synchronous ajax requests, otherwise model eval is late) from a controller
- default controller and action (inherited 'index')
- each view, model or controller has his own hash as private registry to contain variables.
- in views you can write special variable placeholders for other views or for view's variable:
  >	$variable_name$ for variable
  >	{{my_view}} for a view
  these will be replaced with the element content (recusively parsed, within 10 nesting level)
- dinamically load other scripts and stylesheets 
- the content produced by default affects the content of the body, but You can choose to affect
	the content of a node with an ID attribute.
	You can edit the head with some limitations using JMVC.head methods (or your scripts)
- 2.9Kb (minified and packed)
- total warranty for sompletely seo unfriendly pages
- automatic extra parameters from url
- automatic extra parameters from querystring


Url structure
-------------
Supposing we're using virtual host http://www.jmvc.dev , a location will be 

something like: http://www.jmvc.dev / controller_name / action_name / var1/val1/var2/val2/var3 ? var4=Fred&var5=notme&var1=foo
                '-----------------'   '-------------'   '---------'   '----------------------'   '----------------------------'
                         A                   A               A                   A                            A
> proto+domain ----------'                   |               |                   |                            |
                                             |               |                   |                            |
> controller -------------------------------'                |                   |                            |
                                                             |                   |                            |
> action ---------------------------------------------------'                    |                            |
                                                                                 |                            |
> parameters -------------------------------------------------------------------'                             |
                                                                                                              |
> get params (do not override previous) ---------------------------------------------------------------------'


NOTE: parameters are meant to be even, in the controller You will be able
      to access and use 2 variables: var1="val1" and var2="val2"; the third
      one will be ignored because unvalued.

Try it
------
The fastest way to try it out is to create a virtual host or put it online (ex: http://www.jmvc.dev)



API
===


Controller
----------
>>> set(String varname,	Mixed value);
Add a variable to the Controller registry.

>>> get(String varname);
If exists retrieve a variable from the Controller registry.

>>> del(String varname);
If exists deletes a variable from the Controller registry.

>>> relocate(uri location);
Redirects to a specified location.

>>> render(String content,	Javascript function callback);
Renders directly something from the controller.



View
----
>>> set(String varname, Mixed value);
Add a variable to the View registry.

>>> get(String varname);
If exists retrieve a variable from the View registry.

>>> del(String varname);
If exists deletes a variable from the View registry.

>>> parse(Model object);
If the view has some $var$ placeholders within and these
variables are stored in a model instance with the right
names, that method get values from model instance and uses
them in the placeholders content substitution.

>>> render( {
	cback : Javascript function,
	argz : callback array parameters,
	target : dom node id attribute (default document.body)
});
This is the function intended to be used to render the document
or a part of it. You can optionally pass three elements within
a literal object:
cback : a callback function that will be executed after rendereing
argz : an array of parameters that wil be used with the callback
target : the default target is the document.body but if you pass a
	string containing the id attribute of an element that is in the
	DOM (set from previous render with the default target) the content
	will be set in that element.



Model
-----
>>> set(String varname, Mixed value);
Add a variable to the Model registry.

>>> get(String varname);
If exists retrieve a variable from the Model registry.

>>> del(String varname);
